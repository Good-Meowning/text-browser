Meeting minutes Sep 28 2021

Time: 9:00pm

Present: Andi, Evan, Myles, Nicki

- Talked about different choices for tech stack for the project. We discussed terminal UI choices (ncurses, blessed, terminal-kit), http client choices (fetch, axios), and http parsing (cheerio).

- Talked about the trade offs between using typescript and using vanilla javascript

- Talked about container platforms to use. We considered using docker and vagrant.

Questions:

- Should we implement browser tabs?

- How many external libraries can we use?

- Can the setup be a milestone

- How in-depth do team-mate responsibilities have to be?

- What is design in assignment 1? Is it the same as the tech stack?
